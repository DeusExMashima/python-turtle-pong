## Description

This Pong Python Game was created following Following tutorial:
[Python Game Tutorial: Pong - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6jJg9Zan7w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6jJg9Zan7w) by [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://freecodecampt.org). I decided to use object-oriented programming in my take instead of following the whole coding suit. It was a really fun project to work on!

## Tech Stack

I used **Python** and **Turtle** in creating this game following the tutorial. 

## Result and Future Plan

Currently everything works, but I plan to play around more with styling and changing size and improving the flow and smoothness :)

## Installation
1. Git clone this project
2. cd into the terminal
3. run py main.py
4. Enjoy!
